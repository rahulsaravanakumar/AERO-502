# AERO Task Hub user guide

This guide covers the existing release and the Sprint 3 sign-in, shared-project, roster, timeline and reporting changes. Open it any time from **Help** in the page header or from the sign-in page. Every step is written out in words; nothing depends on a screenshot or on color. Every link, field and button can be reached with Tab and used with Enter or Space.

Never put real passwords or private member records in screenshots, notes or training material.

## Sign in

1. Open the website address your team supplied.
2. Select **Sign in with Google** and choose the Google (TAMU) account whose email the Chief Engineer added for you.
3. If your team is still using practice accounts, enter the practice email and password under **or use a practice account** and select **Sign in**.
4. Select **Sign out** in the header when you finish.

Google sign-in does not require a separate website password. Your saved role, class (labeled **Team**) and subteam come from the Chief Engineer's People entry, not from your Google profile. Email matching ignores capitalization. The same approved account has the same access on a laptop or phone.

Use Tab to reach **Sign in with Google** and Enter or Space to activate it. Complete Google's account selection with the keyboard. If you choose an unapproved account, select **Sign in with Google** again and choose the approved TAMU account; no developer setup is needed to switch accounts.

If you see "Access not authorized", see [Messages and what to do](#messages-and-what-to-do). Rejected or cancelled Google sign-in signs you out of any previous website session. If your access is removed, your next page load or submitted action is denied, including an already-open form. Your saved tasks and hours remain.

## Find your work

1. Select **Tasks** to open the task board. It has three columns: Backlog, In progress and Completed.
2. Select **My Tasks** to see only the tasks assigned to you.
3. Select a task title to open its details: deliverables, work instructions, reference links, start and due dates, estimated hours and assigned members.

Members see the tasks assigned to them. Officers see their own team's tasks; the Chief Engineer sees every team.

## Search and filter tasks

1. On the board, My Tasks or the Timeline, type a word in **Search tasks** to match task titles and descriptions.
2. Choose a **Project**, a **Team** and, if needed, a **Subteam**. Projects are listed as "Team · Project" and can include several participating subteams. Subteams are listed with their team, for example "Regular Class · Aerodynamics".
3. Select **Apply**. Only permitted tasks matching the search and selected filters are shown. Leaders can also choose a **Member** and **Task dates from/to**; the date filter includes tasks overlapping that period. Use **Additional teams** to include more classes (hold Ctrl on Windows to select several).
4. Select **Clear** to show every task you are allowed to see again.

Your filters stay applied when you move between the board, My Tasks and the Timeline. A member's board first opens on their own team and subteam.

## Update task status

1. Open a task assigned to you.
2. Under **Update status**, choose Backlog, In progress or Completed.
3. Select **Save status**. The task moves to that column and stays there after you refresh.

## Record actual hours

1. Open a task assigned to you.
2. Under **Record actual hours**, enter the hours as a number greater than 0, such as `1` or `2.5`.
3. Choose the **Date worked** and, if you like, add a short note.
4. Select **Add hours**. The message "Hours were recorded." appears and the entry is listed under **Time entries**.

You can record at most 24 hours for one date across all your tasks.

## Correct or delete your hours

1. Open the task and find your entry under **Time entries**.
2. To correct it, select **Edit**, change the hours or date, and select **Save hours**.
3. To remove it, select **Delete**. The task's actual total updates straight away.

You can change only entries you recorded yourself.

## For officers and the Chief Engineer

### Create or edit a task

1. Select **New Task**.
2. Enter a **Title**, then choose the **Project**. Projects are listed as "Team · Project". Select a **Responsible subteam** that participates in that project; the parent team comes from the project. Officers see only their own team's projects.
3. Enter the **Start date** (today by default), **Due date** and **Estimated hours** (0 or more). Deliverables, work instructions and reference links (one full web address per line) are optional.
4. Tick the members to assign and select **Create Task**. New tasks start in Backlog.
5. To change a task later, open it and select **Edit task**.

### Task history

Open a task you manage and read **History**. Each line gives the date and time, who acted, and what happened in words, for example "Olivia Officer removed Bailey Member" or "changed the status from Backlog to In progress". The newest entry is first, and history cannot be edited or deleted.

### Board summary and hours (the project dashboard)

The task board doubles as the leader dashboard described in the acceptance tests.

1. Select **Tasks**. Each column heading shows how many tasks are in it, and any unfinished task past its due date shows a red **Overdue** label.
2. Choose a **Project**, team, subteam or search, and select **Apply**. The line above the board shows how many tasks are overdue and the actual hours against the estimate for the tasks shown.
3. Scroll to **Hours by member** below the board (or select its link above the board). Set **Hours from** and **Hours to** (both dates are included) and select **Show hours**. Each member's actual hours are shown against their assigned-task estimate as a chart and as a table with the difference.

### Timeline

1. Select **Timeline**. Each task is a bar from its start date to its due date, grouped by team and subteam. Gray is Backlog, blue is In progress, green is Completed, and red stripes mean overdue. The red vertical line is today.
2. Choose how many weeks to **Show** and use the search, team and subteam filters, then select **Apply**.
3. Select **Download timeline CSV** to save the task rows represented by the filtered chart, including the start and due dates. Rows marked Earlier or Later are included, as they are in the readable date list.
4. Use **‹ Previous**, **This week** and **Next ›** to move through time. A task outside the shown weeks says "Earlier" or "Later" on its row.
5. **Dates as a list** below the chart gives the same start and due dates in text.

### Teams, subteams and projects

1. Select **Teams**. Each class (team) lists its subteams, and each subteam lists its projects.
2. Use **Add subteam** to create a subteam. To create a shared project, select **Add project**, choose its parent team, enter its name, tick the participating subteams and save. All participating subteams must belong to that parent team.
3. Select a project's **Rename** action to change its name or participating subteams. Its parent team stays fixed. A subteam with recorded tasks cannot be removed from the project. Use **Archive** to remove a group from everyday lists.
4. Archived groups appear under **Archived**. Select one to see its tasks and hours, or select **Restore** to bring it back.

The Chief Engineer manages every team. Officers manage subteams and projects in their own team only.

### Subteam rosters

1. Select **Teams**, then a subteam's name, and find **Subteam roster**.
2. Chief Engineers manage all rosters; officers manage rosters in their own class only. Members cannot open roster management or submit membership changes.
3. Select an existing approved member under **Add approved member**, then **Add to roster**. Membership does not assign a task.
4. Each row lists the member's permitted assigned work across their class, with its project, responsible subteam and status, or says **No assigned work**. Actual hours are 0 when none were recorded in the selected scope. Choose a project and **Hours from/to**, then **Apply roster scope**, to narrow work and dated hours.
5. Select **Remove membership** to end the membership. Their account, task assignments and historical hours remain. Remove the current membership before adding the person to another subteam.

The initial policy is one active class and one active subteam per person. Membership records preserve join/end dates so the policy can be revised following customer feedback. Projects identify the associated work; this release has no separate sprint entity. Zero recorded hours does not mean someone is available.

### Download reports

1. As a Chief Engineer or officer, apply the project, team(s), subteam, member, search and task-date filters on **Tasks**. A project filter combines work from its participating subteams; add a subteam filter to narrow it further.
2. Select **Download CSV** for the task rows matching that view. The file includes task, project, team, subteam, assignees, status, start/due dates, estimated hours and actual hours.
3. Select **Download member hours** for each relevant member's total, including members with no assignments or hours. **Download project hours** groups the same scoped hours by project. Class and Team columns both identify the parent class in this application.
4. **Hours from/to** use the date the work was recorded for; both endpoint dates are included. Member/date filters apply equally to the displayed summary, task-card actual hours and downloaded totals. Shared task estimates are counted once in the project total.
5. Open the CSV in Excel or Google Sheets. Empty task results produce column headings; member reports still show relevant zero-hour members. Formula-looking names or task titles are exported as literal text for spreadsheet safety.

Members have no export controls. Direct requests are denied. Officers' downloads contain only their own class's permitted work, even if a request supplies another class's filters.

### People (Chief Engineer)

1. Select **People**.
2. Select **Add person**, enter the name and Google email, and choose the role, team and subteam. Select **Add person** to save. The person can sign in with Google straight away, with no separate password. Email capitalization does not matter. Class is labeled **Team**, and the subteam must belong to it.
3. Select **Change role** to change someone's role, team or subteam. The change applies the next time they load a page.
4. Select **Remove access** to stop someone signing in; their tasks and hours are kept. **Restore access** lets them sign in again. Removal also blocks actions submitted from already-open pages. Officers and members cannot open People or change the allowed-users list.
